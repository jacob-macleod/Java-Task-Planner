# Java-Task-Planner
A simple task manager app made in Java and JavaScript

## Rationale
I made this application to practice using Java

## Technical Specs
* This application uses vanilla HTML, Javascript and CSS
* The server uses gradle with Java
* The webserver uses Thymeleaf and Spring Boot

## Development Progress
Development is currently in progress. At the moment, the main base functionality has been developed

## Tasks to Do
1. The CSS needs to be updated to improve the UI of the page
2. Some sort of log in/persistant storage of tasks needs to be implemented
